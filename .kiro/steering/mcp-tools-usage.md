# MCP Tools Usage Guidelines

This project requires the use of specific MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools to enhance development capabilities.

## Required MCP Tools

### 1. Context7
- **Purpose**: Advanced context management and retrieval
- **When to use**: For maintaining context across complex conversations and retrieving relevant information from previous interactions
- **Usage**: Leverage context7 for better understanding of project history and requirements

### 2. Sequential Thinking
- **Purpose**: Structured problem-solving through step-by-step reasoning
- **When to use**: 
  - Breaking down complex problems
  - Planning multi-step implementations
  - Analyzing requirements and design decisions
  - Troubleshooting issues systematically
- **Usage**: Use sequential thinking to ensure thorough analysis before implementation

### 3. Web Search
- **Purpose**: Access to current information and documentation
- **When to use**:
  - Researching best practices
  - Finding up-to-date documentation
  - Verifying technical specifications
  - Discovering solutions to specific problems
- **Usage**: Search for relevant information when designing features or solving technical challenges

## Integration Guidelines

- **Always consider** using sequential thinking for complex decision-making processes
- **Leverage web search** when you need current information about technologies, frameworks, or best practices
- **Utilize context7** to maintain consistency across the project lifecycle

These tools should be used proactively throughout the development process to ensure high-quality, well-researched solutions.
